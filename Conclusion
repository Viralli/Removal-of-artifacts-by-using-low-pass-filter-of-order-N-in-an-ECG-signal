Conclusion

    The proposed method demonstrates a significant improvement in noise reduction from ECG signals while preserving essential fine details that are critical for accurate analysis. Unlike traditional noise removal 

    techniques, which often result in the loss of valuable clinical information, our approach ensures that the integrity of the ECG data is maintained. This is crucial for reliable cardiac monitoring and diagnosis.

Key Achievements:

    Effective Noise Reduction:

        Our method excels in minimizing noise while retaining important signal characteristics. This is achieved through the careful design and implementation of low-pass filters, which effectively eliminate unwanted 

        noise without distorting the original ECG signal.

Preservation of Clinical Information:

    Traditional noise removal methods can sometimes remove or obscure critical information needed for diagnosing cardiac conditions. In contrast, our approach is designed to preserve the fine details of the ECG waveform,

    ensuring that all clinically relevant information remains intact.

Enhanced Clarity and Accuracy:

    By applying low-pass filters, we address common limitations associated with noise removal techniques. The filters used in this project are designed to achieve desirable results even at lower orders, which simplifies 

    implementation without compromising performance.

Comprehensive Signal Analysis:

    The ECG signals used for testing were sourced from a robust database containing both normal and abnormal waveforms. This broad range of data ensures that our method is validated across various scenarios, providing 

    reliable enhancements to ECG signal quality.

Advancement in Cardiac Health Monitoring:

    The improved signal quality resulting from our method supports more accurate diagnostic assessments. By enhancing the clarity of ECG signals, our approach contributes to the overall advancement of cardiac health 

    monitoring, paving the way for better patient outcomes and more effective diagnostic tools.

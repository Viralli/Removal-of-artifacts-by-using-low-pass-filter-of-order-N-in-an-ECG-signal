Project Overview

    This project involved designing and implementing a dual flashing LED circuit using a 555 Timer IC. The circuit was designed to achieve alternating blinking of two LEDs through a continuous square wave signal generated 

    by the 555 Timer. The project spanned from May 2017 to July 2017 and included transitioning from initial breadboard testing to final Printed Circuit Board (PCB) assembly.

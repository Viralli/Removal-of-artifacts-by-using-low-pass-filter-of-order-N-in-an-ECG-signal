Abstract

This project focuses on enhancing the quality of Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals to better distinguish between healthy and unhealthy heart conditions through advanced filtering techniques. ECG signals are crucial for 

diagnosing various cardiac disorders, providing a graphical representation of the heart's electrical activity. The project employs both Kalman and Kaiser Window filters to improve the detection of cardiac abnormalities by

implementing effective noise reduction techniques using MATLAB software.The project is structured into two main phases: filtering and feature extraction. In the filtering phase, both the Kalman Filter and Kaiser Window 

low-pass filter are applied to the ECG signals to remove artifacts and noise. A comparative analysis is conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of these filters in producing cleaner, more accurate ECG signals.The cleaned 

signals are then subjected to feature extraction, which involves analyzing the key components of the ECG waveform: the P wave, QRS complex, and T wave. These components correspond to different phases of the cardiac cycle, 

such as atrial activation and ventricular depolarization. The project also utilizes wavelet transform techniques to further refine the signal, with the Kaiser Window filter demonstrating superior performance in preserving 

essential features while minimizing noise.The filtered signals are sourced from an ECG database that includes both normal and abnormal waveforms. This comprehensive analysis highlights the importance of noise reduction in 

ECG signal processing and provides valuable insights into the heart's electrical performance, aiding in the accurate detection of cardiac abnormalities. The comparative evaluation of the Kalman and Kaiser Window filters

underscores the effectiveness of these techniques in improving ECG signal quality and diagnostic accuracy.

Description of the Output

1. Amplitude vs. Time Plot

  What It Shows:

    The Amplitude vs. Time plot provides a comparative visualization of the original signal and the filtered signal over time. The original signal, depicted in blue, is a 

     noisy sine wave that represents the raw data before any signal processing. In contrast, the filtered signal, shown in red, represents the data after applying a moving

     average filter designed to smooth out the noise.

Purpose:

    The primary purpose of this plot is to illustrate the effect of the filtering process on the signal. The original signal, with its inherent noise, shows significant 

    fluctuations in amplitude due to the random noise component. After filtering, the red curve demonstrates a smoother, less erratic signal, indicating that the filter has 

    effectively reduced the noise while preserving the underlying waveform's main characteristics. This visualization is crucial for evaluating the performance of the filter 

    and ensuring that the noise reduction does not distort the original signal's important features.

    By comparing the amplitude of the original and filtered signals, users can assess how well the filtering process has improved the signal's clarity and how closely the 

    filtered signal approximates the true underlying waveform.

2. Energy vs. Segment Number Plot

What It Shows:

    The Energy vs. Segment Number plot displays the computed energy of each segment of the filtered signal after resampling. This plot provides a detailed view of how the

    energy is distributed across different segments of the signal. Each segment's energy is calculated as the sum of the squared amplitude values within that segment.

Purpose:

    The plot serves to offer insights into the energy distribution of the filtered signal. Higher energy values indicate segments with more significant signal content, 

    which might correspond to periods of increased activity or notable features within the signal. Conversely, lower energy values suggest less active or quieter segments.

    Understanding the energy distribution is essential for applications where the signal's dynamic range and variations are critical. This analysis can help in identifying

    patterns or anomalies in the signal, which might be crucial for further processing or interpretation. For instance, in biomedical signal analysis, such as ECG, varying 

    energy levels could correspond to different cardiac events or conditions, making this plot a valuable tool for signal assessment and diagnostic evaluation.

    Overall, these plots provide a comprehensive view of the signal's behavior before and after filtering, as well as insights into its energy characteristics, thereby 

    supporting effective signal analysis and processing.

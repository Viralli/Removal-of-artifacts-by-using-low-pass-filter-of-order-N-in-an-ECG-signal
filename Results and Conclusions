Results and Conclusions

Here we present the results obtained by applying a Kalman filter to an ECG signal using MATLAB. The analysis involved plotting the normalized frequency response of the filtered ECG signal at various sampling frequencies. 

The Kalman filter, implemented in MATLAB, was used to process the ECG data, resulting in the following observations:

1. Sampling Frequency: 4 kHz

The plot illustrates the normalized frequency versus the final ECG output. The output amplitude initially increases, then decreases, and stabilizes at approximately -20 dB. The phase response starts from zero degrees, 

decreases, and then stabilizes at 0 degrees. - The respective plots for this point are shown in the Read.me file with the following names:

-> Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 4k samples per second - Magnitude

-> Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 4k samples per second - Phase

2. Sampling Frequency: 12 kHz

For this sample rate, the output amplitude shows a similar trend, increasing and then decreasing, eventually stabilizing around -20 dB. The phase response initially decreases, then increases and oscillates before settling 

at approximately -750 degrees. - The respective plots for this point are shown in the Read.me file with the following names:

-> Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 12k samples per second - Magnitude

-> Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 12k samples per second - Phase

3. Sampling Frequency: 20 kHz

The output amplitude again follows the pattern of rising and then declining to around -20 dB. The phase response exhibits slight increases and decreases, ultimately stabilizing around 4000 degrees.

The respective plots for this point are shown in the Read.me file with the following names:

-> output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 20k samples per second - Magnitude

-> Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 20k samples per second - Phase

4. Sampling Frequency: 18 kHz

The amplitude response initially increases, decreases, and repeats this pattern, stabilizing at -20 dB. The phase response starts at 0 degrees, decreases, then increases, and finally settles at approximately -250 degrees.

The respective plots for this point are shown in the Read.me file with the following names:

->  Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 18k samples per second - Magnitude

-> Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 18k samples per second - Phase

5. Sampling Frequency: 2 kHz

At this lower sampling rate, the amplitude response again shows the typical rise and fall, stabilizing at -20 dB. The phase response begins at 0 degrees, decreases, and then stabilizes at approximately 0 degrees.

The respective plots for this point are shown in the Read.me file with the following names:

-> Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 2k samples per second - Magnitude

-> Output for a plot between normalized frequency vs final ECG output at a sample freq of 2k samples per second - Phase

Conclusion

The results demonstrate the consistent behavior of the Kalman filter in processing ECG signals across various sampling frequencies. The amplitude response generally stabilizes at around -20 dB, indicating effective noise 

reduction by the filter. The phase response shows variability depending on the sampling frequency, but each scenario ultimately reaches a stable state. These observations confirm the Kalman filter's efficiency in signal 

processing applications, particularly in maintaining signal integrity while filtering out noise. The MATLAB simulations effectively illustrate these dynamics, providing valuable insights into the behavior of filtered 

ECG signals under different conditions.
